## Ninjo fork (2026-07)

Journal handling for large imported adventures, clean journal editing, and token art.
See the README section "Working with large imported adventures" for the reasoning.

### New Features

- **Clean journal tools** — content stored verbatim, no quest template, no auto-appended junk page
  - `journal-create`, `journal-set-page`, `journal-add-page`
  - `journal-delete-page`, `journal-delete`, `journal-rename`
  - `folder-rename`, `folder-delete`

- **Large-content handling** — Foundry's socket silently drops the connection when a response gets too big; a single 250k-character page killed the bridge reliably
  - Reading: `list-journals` chunks content (`offset` / `maxChars`, default 50k, max 200k) and returns `contentLength` / `hasMore` / `nextOffset`, so partial reads are visible instead of looking complete
  - Writing: `journal-page-from-file` — the browser fetches a file straight from Foundry's Data directory, so **nothing crosses the socket** and size stops mattering
  - `journal-append-page` — alternative write path: create with the first chunk, append the rest

- **`journal-split-page`** — split an oversized page into one page per section
  - Sections detected via `DOMParser` at a chosen heading level; original markup carried over untouched
  - Rarely needed: Foundry already builds a nested table of contents from headings inside a page, and splitting _loses_ that hierarchy because pages cannot nest

- **`journal-rewrite-images`** — external image URLs (CDN) → local Foundry paths; supports `dryRun`

- **`journal-link-tags`** — raw `@creature[…]` / `@item[…]` tags from an import → real `@UUID` links
  - Matches by name **and** by derived document ID (`"mm" + PascalCase(name)`, padded to 16 chars). Localised packs translate names but keep the English 2024 IDs, so `guard` resolves to `Wache` via `mmGuard000000000`. Raised one real chapter from 18 to 96 resolved links
  - Unresolved names are **reported**, never silently skipped
  - Supports `dryRun`

- **`actor-set-token`** — token image, portrait, prototype token name, dynamic ring
  - Enabling the ring sets `ring.enabled` **and** `ring.subject.texture`; with only the flag Foundry draws the ring around an empty field
  - Ring colour follows disposition automatically (hostile red, neutral blue, friendly green), overridable via `ringColor`
  - `tokenName` — without it, placed tokens keep the compendium name instead of the actor's

### Fixes

- `actor-set-token` reset `ring.subject.scale` to `1` on every call with `ring: true`, silently destroying a hand-tuned scale. The field is now only touched when a value is passed
- `journal-split-page` placed new pages at the end of the journal instead of after the source page (Foundry spaces `sort` values 100000 apart, so the naive `+1` sorted last)
- `journal-split-page` found only a single section on imported chapters, which wrap all sections in one container `div`; the parser now descends into it and also recognises an element that _is_ the heading

## v0.8.3 (2026-06-11)

### New Features

- **Mongoose Traveller 2e (mgt2e) System Support**
  - `list-creatures-by-criteria` now works on mgt2e worlds: filters by hit points, psionics, creature type, and actor type; indexed metadata includes characteristic DMs (STR/DEX/etc.)
  - `search-compendium` extracts mgt2e-relevant stats (hits, behaviour, species, tonnage) from search results
  - `manage-world-items` gains a new `describe` action that returns a live enum reference for mgt2e item fields (weapon traits, scales, armour forms, hardware system discriminators, software classes, etc.) — call it before creating items to get valid keys

- **`manage-actors` — generic actor CRUD tool** (works on any game system)
  - `create`: create one or more actors of any type with arbitrary `system` data; mgt2e convenience: accepts skill shorthands (`{ pilot: 2 }`), lowercase characteristic keys, and `system.details` remapped to `system.sophont`
  - `update`: patch existing actors by ID; mgt2e skill shorthands normalised server-side (avoids Electron module-cache issue that prevented browser-side normalisation)
  - `delete`: delete actors by ID
  - `update-items`: update embedded items on an actor by item ID
  - `delete-items`: delete embedded items from an actor by item ID

### Fixes

- `getIndex()` now uses the return value rather than `pack.indexed` state, fixing compendium indexing on Foundry v13 where `pack.indexed` behaviour changed

## v0.8.2 (2026-06-07)

### New Features

- **D&D 5e NPC Creation Suite** (PR #41 by @LManfre)
  - `dnd5e-create-npc` — build a full NPC stat block from scratch (abilities, saves, skills, senses, AC/HP, CR)
  - `dnd5e-add-feature` — one tool with modes: `passive`, `save`, `attack`, `attack-with-save`, `aura`, `spellcasting`, `spells`
  - `dnd5e-add-features-from-compendium` — bulk-import features/spells from compendium packs
  - Targets the dnd5e activities data model (4.x/5.x)

- **WFRP4e (Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4e) System Support** (PR #53 by @nyoung)

  - `get-character` / `list-characters` / `search-character-items` now work on WFRP4e worlds

### Fixes

- **macOS installer** (PR #54): the Claude Desktop config is now merged rather than overwritten, preserving any other configured MCP servers; more robust logged-in-user detection; postinstall scripts no longer abort on a non-critical failure; additional Foundry data-dir locations probed
- **Node 26 install failure** (Issue #51, reported by @frankyh75): removed the unused `better-sqlite3` dependency, which failed to build against Node 26's V8 ABI

---

## v0.6.2 (2025-12-03)

### New Features

    - PF2e: Range, descriptive target, area type (emanation/cone/burst)
    - DSA5: Reichweite, Zielkategorie, Wirkungsbereich

- **Use Item Tool** (`use-item`)
  - Cast spells, use abilities, activate features, consume items
  - Works across systems: D&D 5e, PF2e, DSA5
  - Supports spell upcasting (D&D 5e)
  - Proper resource consumption (spell slots, charges, consumables)
  - GM-only with character targeting
  - **Target Selection**: Specify targets by name or use `["self"]` to target caster
    - Example: "Have Clark cast Magic Missile on the Goblin"
    - Example: "Have Vitch use a healing potion on himself"
    - Targets set via Foundry's targeting system before item use

- **Search Character Items Tool** (`search-character-items`)
  - Token-efficient item search within a character's inventory
  - Filter by type (weapon, spell, feat, equipment, etc.)
  - Filter by category (items, spells, features, all)
  - Text search across item names and descriptions
  - Returns compact results without full descriptions

  - Removed 20-item limit - now returns ALL items
  - ~37% token reduction per character
  - PF2e: traits, rarity, level, actionType
  - D&D 5e: attunement status

### Improvements

- **Documentation** (PR #8)
  - Clarified search-compendium limitations (name-only search, heuristic filters)
  - Directed users to list-creatures-by-criteria for accurate filtering

## v0.4.17 (2025-09-09)

- Wrapper/backend architecture: convert MCP entry to a thin stdio wrapper that proxies to a singleton backend over `127.0.0.1:31414`.
- Backend singleton + lock: backend binds Foundry connector on `31415` and creates `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-backend.lock`.
- Startup race fix: resolves Claude Desktop duplicate-start race by keeping wrappers alive and ensuring only one backend owns ports.
- Runtime stability: backend now bundled (`dist/backend.bundle.cjs`) and preferred by wrapper for reliable startup in installer environments.
- Shared package now emits JS + d.ts, ensuring runtime availability for both dev and installer.
- Logging: wrapper writes to `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-server\wrapper.log`; backend logs to `%TEMP%\foundry-mcp-server\mcp-server.log`.
- Installer: enhanced staging to include full server `dist`, bundled wrapper `index.cjs`, bundled backend, and `node_modules/@foundry-mcp/shared`.
- Build scripts: added root convenience scripts (`build:release`, `bundle:server`, `installer:stage`); NSIS script accepts `--skip-download` and `--skip-nsis` for staging-only runs.

Notes

- No changes needed for CI; existing workflows continue to build bundles and the installer.
- Foundry MCP Bridge port remains `31415`. Control channel is `31414` (internal wrapper↔backend only).
